# k3s

## 1. What is k3s?
k3s is a lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in resource-constrained environments. It provides all the core features of Kubernetes but with a significantly smaller footprint, faster startup, and simplified installation.

## 2. When should it be used?
k3s is ideal when you need:
- A minimal Kubernetes cluster for edge computing or IoT devices.
- A lightweight development or testing environment.
- Fast deployment without the overhead of full Kubernetes distributions.

## 3. Where can it be used?
k3s can run on:
- Edge devices and IoT hardware (Raspberry Pi, small servers).
- Virtual machines and local development machines.
- Cloud instances where minimal resource consumption is preferred.

## 4. Why should I use it?
- Lightweight: Minimal memory and CPU requirements.
- Simple: Easy installation with a single binary and minimal dependencies.
- Production-ready: Fully certified Kubernetes distribution.
- Flexible: Supports ARM and x86 architectures, suitable for edge, IoT, and cloud deployments.
